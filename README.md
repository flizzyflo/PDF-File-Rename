## What is this? 
Do you know this? You do research for a seminar paper or some other work where you rely on scientific sources. You collect tons of pdf files from several webpages and journals and you are so happy that you found all of those interesting papers. Then, you want to find the paper with that fantastic interesting name within your 1000 pdf files. You are sure,  that you will finde the information you need in that specific paper. 
But then, you break down and cry, after you opened up your downloads folder. All of the pdf files have one in common - they have all sorts of names, except their real one. How to figure out which of those was the one you were now looking for? 

This program is designed to tackle excactly this issue. It grabs the metadata of a pdf file, if existing, and extracts both, the author and the title of the paper. Then, it renames the files according to those information, for every single pdf file you have stored in your file folder.
The folder where you have your files stored to be renamed is kept by the variable "PDF_FILE_PATH" in the settings file.

Enjoy, I really like to have the pdf files named correct instead of having weird names.
