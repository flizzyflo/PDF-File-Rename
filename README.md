## Purpose of this programm
Who does not know this? Doing research for a seminar paper or some other work where you rely on scientific sources. You collect tons of pdf files from several webpages and journals, but all have one in common - they are named very strange. 
This program is designed to tackle this issue. It grabs the metadata of a pdf file, if existing, and extracts both, the author and the title of the paper. Then, it renames the files according to those information, for every single pdf file you have stored in your file folder.

The folder where you have your files stored to be renamed is kept by the variable "PDF_FILE_PATH" in the settings file.

Enjoy, I really like to have the pdf files named correct instead of having weird names.
